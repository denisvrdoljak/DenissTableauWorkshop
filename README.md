# Preparation for May 25th
##### After last week's class, we decided to make this seminar more workshop like than a lecture.
##### Therefore, this week's workshop will be more hands on and fun.

## Here is what you are going to do (on the day of workshop or you can start early):
Find a "good" data set. Don't worry. We will go over what is a good dataset on the day of the seminar.

Load the data into Tableau and find 3 interesting things/observations that you find. 

Visualize these interesting things into something you can present with Tableau. 

You will be divided into groups so that you all can learn from each other. 

# Tableau Workshop May 2019
